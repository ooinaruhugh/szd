# szd
Append a zip file to another file.

> I honestly don't remember what szd stands for, so I *guess* it's now "*s*tick *z*ip to *d*ocument". ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I've seen before how people attach zip file with additional content to files they distribute,
e.g. source code to binaries that fly around the internet.
I was like, hey, that's reasonably easy, I could try that for myself.
So here's the probably over-engineered version, in C++, because I was in the mood to do C++ again.

# Usage
It's plain, there are no flags. Just do
```
szd target source
```
